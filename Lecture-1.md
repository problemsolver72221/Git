Tutorial for HackYourFuture Git basics :octocat:. This tutorial has three sections:
1. Git
2. GitHub
3. Using Git

# 1. Git : 

## 1.1 What is Git, Etymology and a short history.
* [ ] Version Control (aka Revision control, source control)
* [ ] Distributed version control system, Linus Torvalds, 2005
* [ ] GIT: Global Information Tracker or the stupid content tracker or unpleasant person in British slang

## 1.2 Installing Git
 For Windows,
 install Git for Windows:
 https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.10.2.windows.1

 For Linux, open gnome-terminal for GNome desktops  or Konsole for KDE desktops and type the command to install git based on your Linux distribution. 

 For a RedHat based Linux (Like CEntOS)
```
 sudo yum install git
```

 For Fedora
```
 sudo yum install git-core
```

 For a Debian based Linux (like Ubuntu)
```
 sudo apt-get install git 
```

 For Arch Linux
```
 sudo paceman -Sy git
```

 For Gentoo Linux
```
 sudo emerge ask â€”verbose dev-util/git
```

 For a MAC, open Terminal and execute following command
```
 brew install git
```

# 2. GitHub: 

## 2.1 What is GitHub 
 GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

 Registering/Creating the account on GitHub
 You need
* A valid Email address
* An SSH key-pair


## 2.2 Generating the ssh keypair

 For Windows MSysGit/GitBash command prompt use
```
ssh-keygen.exe -C "username@email.com" -t rsa
```

 For Linux/MAC, use
```
ssh-keygen -C "username@email.com" -t rsa
```

Supply your Github email address instead of this fake one. 
Accept the default location storage (default file) for the keys. When prompted for a passphrase, make up one, and don't forget it ! This is your private key, do not share it with anyone.
You will have `id\_*rsa` and `id\_rsa.pub` files in the directory at the following path `/c/Users/<your_user_name>/.ssh/`

 You want to copy the contents of the id\_rsa.pub (open it with a simple text editor or use the command cat in the Bash)
 After you copy the contents of the id\_rsa.pub file, Go to the GitHub account, go to the settings find SSH and GPG keys option and add New SSH key.

## 2.3 Creating a repository

Using your GitHub account, create a repository to which you can add files. Name the repository as MyFirst. Create a public repository and check the box to create a README file. After you create the repository, the URL of your web page would be something like https://github.com/unmeshvrije/MyFirst . Replace unmeshvrije with your username. If you append .git to this URL, you will get the name of your GitHub repository: https://github.com/unmeshvrije/MyFirst.git



# 3. Using Git

## 3.1 Creating the repository
```
Create a new directory in your home directory or any other suitable location using
$mkdir hello-world
Enter it
$cd hello-world
and create a new git repository using 
$git init
```

You can clone a repository with `git clone <URL>` command. This copies the repository from a remote machine and initializes it on your machine. You can try to clone some public repositories on github.com

Need some more explanation? Than check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xDSfNTi3p4&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) video Daan made about how to set up a new Git repo 

## 3.2 Workflow
 Working Directory -> Index -> HEAD
 your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. the first one is your Working Directory which holds the actual files. the second one is the Index which acts as a staging area and finally the HEAD which points to the last commit you've made.

 configure your email and username of Github in the git
 ```
$git config --global user.email "username@email.com"
$git config --global user.name "username"
```
The username does not have to be same as your GitHub username.

## 3.3 add and commit
```
 #You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
 $git add <filename>
 #This is the first step in the basic git workflow.
 
 #To actually commit these changes use
 $git commit -m "Commit message"
```

## 3.4 Pushing changes
```
#If you have not cloned (Our case) an existing repository and want to connect your repository to a remote server, you need to add it with

$git remote add origin https://github.com/unmeshvrije/MyFirst.git
Replace the URL with the repository you created in step 2.3

 Now you are able to push your changes to the selected remote server i.e. your remote repository on GitHub.
 Your changes are now in the HEAD of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute 
 $git push -u origin master
```
# Troubleshooting
You could encounter errors if you do not follow the exact procedure as described above.
```
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:myrepo.git'

Solution:

$ git pull origin master
```

```
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories

Solution:

$ git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin master
```
