# Git
This repository contains the course material for the Git course.

Git course was first introduced in the Hack Your Future (HYF henceforth) in September 2016. We think that learning Git is one of the useful skills to become a successful and efficient software engineer. The aim of this course is to learn the basics of Git and not to be an expert. The Git module was designed to be taught in three two-hour lectures.

We want to use this repository as an archive of course material (slides/tutorials), useful resources, teaching ideas etc.
